    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide insights into how data points are distributed and how much they deviate from the central tendency (e.g., mean, median). Here's how each measure is used and an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "Use: Range gives you a sense of how spread out the data points are in the dataset. A larger range indicates a wider spread, while a smaller range suggests less variability.\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of daily high temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit for a city over a month: [70, 72, 75, 68, 80, 85, 63]. The range is 85 (maximum) - 63 (minimum) = 22 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating a considerable temperature variation during the month.\n",
    "Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Variance quantifies the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "Use: Variance measures the overall spread or dispersion of data points around the mean. A higher variance suggests greater variability, while a lower variance indicates less variability.\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of exam scores for a class: [85, 90, 88, 92, 78]. The mean is 86.6. The variance is calculated as (1/n) Σ(xi - x̄)², where n is the number of data points. For this dataset, the variance is approximately 19.2, indicating moderate variability in exam scores.\n",
    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average deviation of data points from the mean.\n",
    "Use: Standard deviation is a widely used and interpretable measure of dispersion. It provides a measure of how spread out data is while maintaining the original unit of measurement.\n",
    "Example: Using the same exam scores dataset, the standard deviation is approximately 4.39 (rounded to two decimal places). This value tells us that, on average, each score deviates from the mean by about 4.39 points. A higher standard deviation indicates more significant variability."
