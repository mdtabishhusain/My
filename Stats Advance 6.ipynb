    "i.\tOne way ANOVA: One factor with at least 2 levels, these levels are independent. Example – Doctor want to test a new medication to decrease headache. They split the participants in 3 conditions [10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg]. Doctor ask the participant to rate the headache on a scale of 1 – 10. Here medications of 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg are the factors (variables) and rate of headache after taking the medication are the levels. We can see each level is independent as each medication has its own property and impact so One way ANOVA can be applied on these type of datasets.\n",
    "ii.\tRepeated measures ANOVA: One factor with at least 2 levels, these levels are dependents. Example – 3 person, preparing for armed forces, practice running on daily basis. Their variation in distance is recorded for 3 days. Here running on each day is the factor and distance covered by each person are the levels. We can see distance covered by each person is dependent on distance covered by same person on previous day as he may got some injury or may be he was tired therefore next day distance reduced. So repeated measures ANOVA is applied on these type of datasets.\n",
    "iii.\tFactorial ANOVA: 2 or more factors each of which with at least 2 levels, these levels can be either independent or dependent. Considering the previous example, here gender is another factor added and on these type of datasets factorial ANOVA can be applied.\n"

There are several methods to handle missing data, and the choice of method can impact the results and conclusions of your analysis. Here are some common approaches to handling missing data in a repeated measures ANOVA and their potential consequences:\n",

    "In this approach, any case (subject) with missing data on any variable is removed from the analysis.\n",

    "Cons: Reduces the sample size, potentially leading to loss of statistical power and biased results if data are not missing completely at random (MCAR).\n",
    "Pairwise Deletion (Available Case Analysis):\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, cases with missing data are retained for analyses involving variables for which they have data, but not for variables with missing data.\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "Pros: Retains more data than complete case analysis.\n",
    "Cons: Can lead to inconsistent results across different analyses involving different subsets of cases. Standard errors may not reflect the true variability.\n",
    "Mean Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values are replaced with the mean of the observed values for that variable.\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "Pros: Simple and preserves the sample size.\n",
    "Cons: May introduce bias if missing data are not MCAR. It can underestimate variability and lead to incorrect standard errors and p-values.\n",
    "Interpolation or Regression Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values are estimated based on the relationship between variables using techniques like linear interpolation or regression.\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "Pros: Can provide more accurate imputations than mean imputation.\n",
    "Cons: Requires assumptions about the relationships between variables. Results may be sensitive to model assumptions.\n",
    "Multiple Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple imputations are generated, creating several complete datasets with imputed values. Analyses are conducted on each dataset, and the results are combined to provide valid estimates and standard errors.\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "Pros: Provides unbiased estimates and valid standard errors when missing data are missing at random (MAR). Accounts for uncertainty in imputations.\n",
    "Cons: More complex to implement than other methods.\n",
    "Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):\n",
    "\n",
    "MLE is a statistical method that estimates model parameters while accounting for missing data. It is often used in software designed for repeated measures ANOVA.\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "Pros: Provides valid estimates when data are missing at random (MAR) and does not require imputations.\n",
    "Cons: May be computationally intensive and may require specific software.\n",
    "The choice of method for handling missing data should be based on the nature of the missing data (MCAR, MAR, or not missing at random), the amount of missing data, and the goals of the analysis. It is generally recommended to explore the reasons for missing data and assess the impact of different methods through sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of your findings."
